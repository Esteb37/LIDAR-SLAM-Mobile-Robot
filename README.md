# ðŸ¤– Autonomous Navigation PuzzleBot 

This project utilizes ROS 1 to implement autonomous navigation of a simulated robot called PuzzleBot in a Gazebo environment. The use instructions included demonstrates the process of creating the ROS package, setting up the simulation launch in Gazebo, and 
configuring RVIZ for visualizing both mapping and navigation of the robot.
